      Im going to tell you a Story. I hope your old enough to understand this when you get it. youre only 4 now. anyway. Once then Lived this young man
      he was A little lost in his way. but soon to find a good job and some good friends to rely on. this young man was a desperate lover. Any and every
      girl he ever dated. Cheated on him. Lied to him. And showed him how much he wasnt worth anything. Untill This one girl came along. her name was Sally.
      Sally was diffrent type of girl. even tho she wasnt fat.. she wass curvy... even tho she wasnt ugly she Absolootley knew how to put her make up on. And boy
      did she know how to catch a guys eye. well this young man. was a bit hesitent. He didnt want to rush. he didnt want to have sex. He wanted to test the waters.
      See if she was really into him. well. what do you think Happened... She disappeared for almost a week. the young man being the young man didnt pay it no mind
      they had only hung out one time. If she wanted to see where things could go she would hit him up. well after that week went by. DINGG goes his phone.
      Low and behold its.. Sally!!! Sparks get to flying. They are texting back and forth. They are Hanging out! Together probley 3 nights a week. still no sex tho.
      you see sex is something that mean something to the young man. its more of making love with someone. its like being connected.. anyway. 3 months go by.
      the young man and sally are still in their teens. (19 to be excat) its Holloween Night. and man have the you man and sally really been having a good time together.
      pretty much live with sally now. Anyway the young man and sally are at this little shin dig. Everyone is cutting up. Jokes are flying songs are playing. even without
      it being said. the body launge between him and sally. is getting intence.. They aint much to party together. so he keeps his distance to let her know he doesnt
      want to control her. sally is running around doing her thing... well a good hour goes by. and he hasnt seen her.. he thinks nothing of it.. Another hour goes by..
      Did she leave the Young man asks himself. so he starts to maybe check the outside. or maybe inside the house. well as soon as he steps out the garage door to the back yard.
      He hears sallys laugh. "shit" he says to himsself.. chugged his beer for an excuse to walk to the cooler for another one. he doesnt want to seem like he is stalking her.
      Well anyway. he is walking by and all the girls are just a giggling. so he hollers at them something weird. Sally sees him. she comes over to him. he asked what was funny.
      her konwing the comfortablity they have with one another. she tells him that she just seen a prieced dick. A what he says. with a little anger in his voice. 3 moths he has been
      trying to see if this girl was worth fighting for if he ever had the change. In his mind all he can think is what the fuck would somone just up and show their privte parts to
      a buch of girls for. what in the hell did this guy think of this girl that ive been crushing on for sometime now.. She calms him down reasures him that he was not who she wanted
      to be with. Without asking. got that comfort and aso got the Tonight is the night. type vibe.. so you know what happend. blah blah blah. I loves you made the story. yadda yadda yadda
      Then. for the young man. things aint looking very good. he cant find work. maybe he can he just doesnt enjoy the job. He has been sleeping at sallys house for quite some time now.
      He starts to get that feeling that he is just a burdand more than the one she loves anymore. well the 4th of july comes around. the young man and sally had been fighting alot
      now lately over the stupid shit everyone always fights about. Well they are at the lake. he doesnt want to continue the fight infront of sally's parents. so he just leaves
      she tries to find him at the end of the night. but he brushes her off still mad at something stupid. blah blah blah. they miss oneanother so he comes over the next day.
      Then Bam!!! he lands his old job back. making 15 an hr and 70 dollars a day perdieam. boy things start to look up. the old house that they was staying at when him and sally
      first met. had become vacant. plus the young man was tired of living with sally and her mom. He needed to prove to sally that he could hold down a job. and that she could
      rely on him to do what was needed to be done. Well about a week goes by after getting that job. and setback. he ends up in jail. the young man got pulled over and had a warrent
      the next moring. wouldnt you know it. he bail has been made. and he is a free man. he walks out them gates. and sees sally stading there with tears in her eyes. it was at the moment he knew
      She actuly Loved him. she had convinced her mother to bail him out of jail.. well no more than 4 days go by... one of his buddies that he was going to be roommates wtih
      had dropped some disturbing news on the young man. so he calls sally and asks about it. The young mans friend says he has proof. so he asks her again
      Still she denies... they start fighting. but the words that is coming from the you mans mouth are ment to hurt because the news he had gotten hurt him. Hurt him to the point of
      lashing out on the one he loved. The news was that the night they got in the fight on the 4th of july. She went and cheated on him with her x.. yes. you read that right.
      all the waiting. and ensureing and just making sure she wasnt going to be just like the rest. failed. she failed him. she is Not who she preseted herself to be.
      she was just like all the rest. she was only in it to show the young man how worthless he really was.... I wish the story stoped there. but it doesnt. that same ruteeen that same
      cycle kept happening. and it never stoped for 7 or 8 years. the young man didnt know what to do he had dont spent the time and energy into loving this woman he was lost.
      they had a child together during this period of time. he was so scared that he wasnt his that he left. you see he was told that when sally and her friends went to get
      the pregancy test. that sally had mentchend that she didnt know if the child she could be caring could be one of 2 peoples. ONE OF 2. The young man had always thought that he couldnt
      have childern anyway. and the other person. already had a child.... so he put two and two together and poof he was gone. he says that he was gone for maybe 2 weeks. she says he was gone for 3 months.
      All the young man could do was cry. and he got tired of doing that so for him to fall asleep his would get drunk and pass out. they had kept in contact like they always had. but not really much of visable
      just threw text. well they went and had lunch one day. she asked him over after wards. he refused. he was still comfused. what if she was tricking him into raising another mans
      child. he finaly gave in and said if there is a change of the little one being his. he wanted apart of its life. things was really going good. then one night sally and the young man was
      horse playing the living room. and the young man had grabbed her trying to make her sit on his lap. she didnt let that happen. laughing around the courner. she takes off running to
      the toilt. Young man pays it no mind. she comes back out. and says i thik my water just broke. The young man and sally start freaking out. its time its time! we call and sure enough
      her water is broke!!!! 10 hours. later this Little perfect human enters the world. weighing in at 7lbs 6ounces. 2 weeks early but shes as helthy as a baby could be. We both fall in love
      all that worrying and anger that was built up in the yount mans heart had vanished. the next morning. the young man wakes up. and sally and their little one is in the next bed
      they are both looking beautiful as ever. the young man check his phone. and sees something odd. a friends request from his new born. what the heak. he thinks. who what why. he grew with annger why wasnt he
      who would make his daughter a facebook without even asking permission. Sally. Sally did. in her mind she desont need an excuse. looking back now. that would have been the moment that he knew it
      didnt matter anymore. he didnt matter anymore. be there or not. she didnt care for him anymore. if she had any love for me left it was all given up to love for that babby.
      things just got worse. he still wanted the attenchin. she woundt give in to him. she wouldnt see him she woulndt make love she wouldnt act like he was alive. he gotten laid off the day
      the little one was born. he couldnt win. Nothing was goin in his favor. couple months go by he lands a job starts to get them on their feet again and still. nothing out of sally.
      in his eyes she doesnt want him. he checks her phone to see if his suspesnes are true. and wouldnt you know it she told her best friend that she wished she didnt let the
      young man sing the Bitch certificate to the little one. so he leaves.. they have a child suport agreement and visitation aggreement. but he is missing what he worked for all them years ago now there
      is another human with his last name and he doesnt even get to enjoy it. so he shoots for the stars. trys to win them back. fails. and fails. and fails. they talk maybe have a little love probley once a couple months.
      he keeps doin whatever she wants. and he keeps appoligizing for it. he is getting tired of not being herd and over looked and laughed at. he has now lost everything. even renting a house for his family. sally and the young man
      sign at the dotted line. 10 days they make it. before she gets caught texting one of her exs. and while taking the little one to school pops in over at his place.
      All the pain and anger right back at it. he flips. and becomes the start of wishing he wasnt the one to get so mad. becuse now it doesnt matter what she done. her argument now is. why would she want to
      be with someone who talks to her the way that the young man did. but when he says he wouldnt have done that if she wouldnt have done that. to her it doesnt matter. to her he is the one who
      cant respect her. and from that day. he has been doing everything and anthing he can to make his family work. she keeps saying yes and doin what she does, he flips then blames him. its gotten this young man so bent
      out of shape. and so sick to his heart he cant even breathh. he becomes a hermet. dont do anything anymore doesnt drink doesnt go to the bar. he just plays his game. he falls intto depression. hard. there is only one person who
      save him. She refuses. still blames him for the way he talks to her. it gets to the point. that when he sees his litte one all he can do is cry the young man is hurting he change of love was ripped out from underneath him
      as if the devil himself did it. he is so far down the rabbit hole he is goin to walmart just to catch the caronavirus so he doesnt have to put a bullet in his head.
